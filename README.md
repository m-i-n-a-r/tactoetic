## Introduction
Just a plain good ol' Java Tic Tac Toe game, implemented using my style and good to start developing Android apps. It's intended to only be used in local multiplayer atm.

## Features
- 3\*3, 4\*4 and 5\*5 grids
- Easy to use
- Light and dark themes (Android 10 dark mode supported)
- Selectable accent (no app restart needed)
- Beautiful animations
- Multiwindow support
- Extremely lightweight

## Credits
This app was written during my free time as a training. Many good devs have helped me understanding the best practices and they taught me a lot of useful tricks. **Every translation is well appreciated!**
